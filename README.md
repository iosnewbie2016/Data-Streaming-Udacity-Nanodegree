## Table of Contents

#### Lessons 

1. [Data Ingestion with Kafka & Kafka Streaming](https://github.com/nesreensada/Data-Streaming-Udacity-Nanodegree/tree/master/Part1_Data_Ingestion_with_Kafka_%26_Kafka_Streaming)

2. [Streaming API Development and Documentation](https://github.com/nesreensada/Data-Streaming-Udacity-Nanodegree/tree/master/Part2_Apache_Spark_and_Spark_Streaming)

#### Projects

1. [Optimize Chicago Bus
and Train Availability
Using Kafka](https://github.com/nesreensada/Data-Streaming-Udacity-Nanodegree/tree/master/Projects/Optimizing_public_transportation): A streaming event pipeline around Apache Kafka and its ecosystem. Using public data from the Chicago Transit Authority we will construct an event pipeline around Kafka that allows us to simulate and display the status of train lines in real time. **tools**: python, Kafka, Faust Stream processor and KSQL.

2. Analyze San Francisco Crime Rate with Apache Spark Streaming: real-world dataset, extracted from Kaggle, on San Francisco crime incidents, and you will provide statistical analyses of the data using Apache Spark Structured Streaming. **tools**: python, Kafka, Spark Streaming.
