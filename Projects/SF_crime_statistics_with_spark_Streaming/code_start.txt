# questions

How did changing values on the SparkSession property parameters affect the throughput and latency of the data?

spark.executor.memory : setting executor memory spark.executor.cores : setting executor cores spark.driver.memory : setting driver memory numInputRecords : The number of records processed in a trigger inputRowsPerSecond : The rate of data arriving processedRowsPerSecond : The rate at which Spark is processing data

What were the 2-3 most efficient SparkSession property key/value pairs? Through testing multiple variations on values, how can you tell these were the most optimal?

spark.default.parallelism : 3 spark.streaming.kafka.maxRatePerPartition : 10




Question 1
How did changing values on the SparkSession property parameters affect the throughput and latency of the data?

It either increased or decreased processedRowsPerSecond

Question 2
What were the 2-3 most efficient SparkSession property key/value pairs? Through testing multiple variations on values, how can you tell these were the most optimal?

The options with the most effect was the following, set to the respective values.

The meassure I used to guage the effect was processedRowsPerSecond and the highest value I observed was 301.5151515151515

spark.sql.shuffle.partitions                10
spark.streaming.kafka.maxRatePerPartition   10
spark.default.parallelism                   10000
